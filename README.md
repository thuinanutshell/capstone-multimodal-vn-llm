# Impact of Vietnamese Linguistic Features on Multimodal LLMs' Performance Across Audio Tasks
## Abstract
This research investigates how Vietnamese linguistic features influence Multimodal Large Language Models' performance across audio tasks. While existing studies have prioritized data collection representing Vietnamese phonetic diversity and fine-tuning pre-trained models on specialized datasets, a systematic analysis of how specific Vietnamese linguistic characteristics affect model performance remains unexplored. Our work addresses this gap by examining how tonal properties, syllable structures, and regional variations in Vietnamese impact model accuracy, processing efficiency, and generalization capabilities across speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and translation tasks. Through comparative analysis with non-tonal languages, we identify key linguistic challenges and propose targeted architectural modifications to improve Vietnamese audio processing in Multimodal LLMs. This research contributes to both computational linguistics and natural language processing by providing a deeper understanding of language-specific factors affecting multilingual audio capabilities in foundation models.
